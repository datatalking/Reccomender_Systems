1. update the script
2. migrate into a main that runs 6 scripts
3. things you could do with existing data
4. things you cannot do ... without more data or other stuff.

### Current Features
- Local csv file
- 

### TODO or Future Features
- Transition existing local csv files into SQLite db
- Improve flow of data
- Unittest to detect types
- PyTest to check for column headers
- Gantt Chart of Features vs Functionality
- Update data based on url importing data with `import requests`
  - Also data will need to be cleaned upon future importation.
